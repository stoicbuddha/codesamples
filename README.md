# Code Samples

Samples of code I have written

## journalsController.js

A controller from the API I am designing for a side-project in Restify/Node. This is a very recent code sample that I believe displays what I want to display as a developer

## projects_controller.php

A controller from a different side-project about 6 months ago. This has fewer warts than the affialites_controller.php file, but it still has a couple that I noticed looking back, including improperly accessing the DB from the controller.

## affiliates_controller.php

A controller from the same side-project as journalsController.js, in a previous Laravel-based iteration. This is about 1.5 years older, and has more warts from a commenting/coding perspective. I have it available to show two things:

1. I am not afraid to take responsibility for my coding sins.
2. I have grown as a developer.
